## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase structure derived from 73 requirements across 12 categories
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 (Signal Pipeline) consolidates strategy selection, signal generation, risk management, and gold intelligence into one vertical slice
- [Roadmap]: Production deployment (Railway) deferred to Phase 7 -- local development through Phases 1-6

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Twelve Data free tier rate limits (800 req/day) may be insufficient -- design aggressive caching from Phase 1
- vectorbt walk-forward API depth needs prototyping in Phase 3 -- fallback is manual pandas implementation
- Economic calendar API selection unresolved -- evaluate during Phase 5 planning
